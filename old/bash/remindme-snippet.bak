# 1. place this file somewhere, e.g., ~/scripts/remindme.sh
# 2. create a symbolic link to this file in /usr/local/bin
# sudo ln -s ~/scripts/remindme.sh /usr/local/bin/remindme
# 3. make the symlink executable
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/remindme # 4. launch your first reminder from anywhere in terminal
# remindme "hydration check" 7 3
# (a hydration check every 7 minutes for 3 hours)

# Bonus: if you want these commands to run in
# the background (and free up your terminal)
# add this to your $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.zshrc
